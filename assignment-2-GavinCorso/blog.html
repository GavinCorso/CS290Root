		<h2><a href="index1.html">Assignment 1</a></h2>
		<p>This first assignment was a good refresher on the basics of html and git. It has been about 3 years since I built a basic website so it provided an oppurtunity to refamiliarize myself with the basics of html. I also found it to be a lot more easy to understand this time around having had experience with more coding languages. The challenges I found were in the little things, remembering which command served what purpose (ie linking files together.) I was able to just use the resources provide in class and on the course website to develop my website but I will certainly be checking for more complicated visual effects and formatting in the future. The key changes I want to make to my program include the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Positionial formatting, centering and alligninment for each component to be more visually appealing</li>
			<li>Text formatting, making my text unique is an important part of setting my website apart and making it look more professionial across browsers</li>
			<li>Background colors and other "spices" to make the page more interesting</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2><a href="index.html">Assignment 2</a></h2>
		<p>I found this second assignment to be a fun hybrid between coding and graphic design. I enjoyed trying to imitate the style displayed, and it has given me ideas for how I might implement things in my own projects. I initially struggled with understanding the different structural elements. For example, the header would cut off even at max size, because the image expanded the page. Then the flex box was set to nowrap but the text continued to wrap. It took a lot of trouble shooting for such a small task, yet other elements went by super quickly. It's much like any form of coding where you can move quickly through it but get caught up on something small for a lot of time. I think my favorite part was making the shift to different fonts and colors. It is amazing how much of a difference the details make.</p>
