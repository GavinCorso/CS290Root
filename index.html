		<h1>Gavin Corso's Code Blog</h2>
		<h2><a href="assignment-1-GavinCorso/index.html">Assignment 1</a></h2>
		<p>This first assignment was a good refresher on the basics of html and git. It has been about 3 years since I built a basic website so it provided an oppurtunity to refamiliarize myself with the basics of html. I also found it to be a lot more easy to understand this time around having had experience with more coding languages. The challenges I found were in the little things, remembering which command served what purpose (ie linking files together.) I was able to just use the resources provide in class and on the course website to develop my website but I will certainly be checking for more complicated visual effects and formatting in the future. The key changes I want to make to my program include the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Positionial formatting, centering and alligninment for each component to be more visually appealing</li>
			<li>Text formatting, making my text unique is an important part of setting my website apart and making it look more professionial across browsers</li>
			<li>Background colors and other "spices" to make the page more interesting</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a href="assignment-2-GavinCorso/index.html">Assignment 2</a></h2>
		<p>I found this second assignment to be a fun hybrid between coding and graphic design. I enjoyed trying to imitate the style displayed, and it has given me ideas for how I might implement things in my own projects. I initially struggled with understanding the different structural elements. For example, the header would cut off even at max size, because the image expanded the page. Then the flex box was set to nowrap but the text continued to wrap. It took a lot of trouble shooting for such a small task, yet other elements went by super quickly. It's much like any form of coding where you can move quickly through it but get caught up on something small for a lot of time. I think my favorite part was making the shift to different fonts and colors. It is amazing how much of a difference the details make.</p>

		<h2><a href="assignment-3-GavinCorso/index.html">Assignment 3</a></h2>
		<p> This assignment made for an interesting beginning but the second part had me stumped. I was able to understand the basic architecture for how the implementation could be done but I was unable to find the right way to access elements within the array. The plan was to simply store the values of the posts so I could remove and readd them when need be but I was unable to perform the comparisons with the nested elements. For example, I had the post as a single index in the array but I was unable to access the posts name or price. This served as a roadblock that I was unable to solve, and a reminder to start my coding assignments earlier so I have more time to seek support.</p>

		<h2><a href="assignment-4-GavinCorso/server.js">Assignment 4</a></h2>
		<p>This assignment felt like the simplest one thus far. It was daunting at firs but once I reviewed the lecture it was a lot easier to understand. The one thing that I wasn't as confident on going into it was the ability to write out the files. The logic was very simple so I didn't have any trouble with it, just needed to learn the setup and the proper commands for each check. It was surprising to see how simple it can be to construct a server so I am looking forward to implementing this in future projects.</p>

		<h2>Assignment 5</h2>
		<p>This was a very satisfying project. It was not without frustration, but getting over certain difficulties (like adapting the mechanicsm to suit an array of posts or just an individual post) really helped with understanding the structure. I started out working side by side with the lecture, adding the basic express and handlebar functioniality. The first obstacle occured with the addPost function. It was failing to pass on the information through the template due to case sensisitivity. After solving the first issue things went along speedily until the third portion of the project. I was once again having issue with data manipulation. Reading from the json file to console was easy enough, but it took me a bit of rethinking to figure out the split functioniality between individual posts as opposed to all of them. I enjoyed the challenges this project presented.</p>
