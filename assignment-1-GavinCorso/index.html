		<h2>A little more about me...</h2>
		<p>I have completed a very basic web development course back in high school but it has been a while so I am a bit rusty. I practiced making a simple website with basic hyperlink chains and media, nothing too special.</p>
		<p>I am hoping to become more familiar with HTML and javascript, the more coding languages I am familiar with the better!</p>
		<p>I have indeed signed up for campuswire</p>
		<p>One of my most crazy stories was back when I accidentally ran a marathon on the Pacific Crest Trail <i>without food or water.</i></p>
